Squib
-----

Students were required to write a short paper on a phenomenon related to the topics discussed in class. The paper should describe the phenomenon, explain its significance (what theoretical issues does it bear on?), and present (at least) a preliminary account of it.

In the paper, students were asked to:

*   Describe the set of data under investigation
*   Explain why those data are interesting or puzzling
*   Explain how the data bears on existing theories
*   Indicate how the data can be analyzed

There were two required meetings. The first was to learn more about studentsâ€™ background and interests. The second was for discussing potential squib topics. The second meeting was important, because often the most difficult part of writing a paper is finding a suitable topic. Although no list of topics was provided, students received help in narrowing down a topic.

Although there was no set page length, at least 10 pages including figures was generally necessary to explore the topic.

The papers were graded on clarity of argumentation.
